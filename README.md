## Overview

Project Wish is a simple but highly configurable mod that allows modpack creators to create rock types with a large amount of ores and gems to allow for more complex recipes. Ore generation is highly configurable allowing the modpack to change the ores how they see fit. Ore is generated in clustering simular to the mod <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfcraft">TerraFirmaCraft</a> with simular ore prospecting aswell. To improve prospecting I recommend my compain mod <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mining-goggles">Mining Goggles</a>
